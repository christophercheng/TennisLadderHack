TennisRungs.Com Ladder Hack

TennisRungs.com is an online tennis ladder used by the Fort Green Tennis Assocation. In 2017, over 150 folks competed in two ladders managed by the FGTA.  Frustrated by feature limitations with the ladder software, I built a hack that allowed me to automatically challenge players of my choosings -- as soon as they became available to be challenged.  Previously, It became very difficult to challenge players ahead of me. (A player could only be challenged by one person at a time, and everyone wanted to challenge the players at the top of the ladder).

The hack was written with a simply python script.  It utilized a phantom headless browser to log in to the site on a configurable schedule, check the availability of a configurable list of players, and challenge any that were available.  

Results: the hack worked like a charm.  I did feel sort of guilty about gaining an unfair advantage in the ladder, so I made it publicly known what I was doing and offered to run the hack for anyone else that requested it.  Furthermore, I took over running the ladder for the winter season, and obviously had to cease using the hack.  So it's on the shelf, for now :-)
